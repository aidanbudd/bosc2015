# Hangout session: 2015.11.18, at 2:00 pm GMT+1

In this meeting we can discuss other parts of the article, like the
structure and order of the features, introduction, questionnaire etc.

## We planned to discuss

- **Introduction: Who would like to write this?**
- **Further ideas?**
- **What about the questionnaire?**
    - Decide criteria by which to choose the set of communities to contact:
        - e.g. one of us has reason to consider this community in some way great/successful
    - Score this list <https://github.com/aidanbudd/bosc2015/blob/master/listOfOSBCs.md> according to that criteria to decide which ones to contact
    - Decide who contacts which community in which time-frame
    - Decide how to ask them to contribute answers to our questions:
        - e.g. email to one of us AND fork/pull requests on this github repo - they give their permission that we name their community and provide an (edited) version of what they describe as part of the document, and record exactly what they say as a supplemenratry material file for the manuscript
        - offer all of them the option to join us as authors of the document, if they contribute this information to us
    - Choose a short set of questions/topics to ask each of them for feedback on e.g.:
    - which of the features of great open source scientific communities,    that we've come up with, do they see as most important for the success of their community?
    - anecdotes from their own community that illustrate the importance of these features to the success of their community
    - anecdotes from their own community about how to build/establish these features in their community

## We decided

- To approach a small set of communities for feedback on their success, determining the list of communities to approach based on our voting of our current list of possible communities - Bastien, Konrad, Aidan, Malvika already voted, we each placed our name 6 times on the list given below, and will approach the ones the top 10-scoring ones initiall - *PLEASE VOTE BY MONDAY NOVEMBER 23 2015 IF YOU WERTRENT IN THE MEETING*
- We'll tell them "we will make public what you say, editing it into the
manuscript, and providing also excatly the text you provide as
supplementary material and as a file in the github repo - please give us
explicit consent for us to do this"
- Before we appraoch them we want to make the current text more consistent
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1heUlOl0YPSPTxEpqPEAIGKbtjPApU1Nfd_JmZjX1HSo/edit#heading=h.mo16u0hzrclf>
- to do that:
    - anyone who has the time should mail the whole list and say "I'll do it tomorrow" and then edit the text so that it has a similar style, and similar kind of content, for each 'feature"
    - otherwise, if noone else does it by then, Malvika will do this on her 10-hour flight 10th December, and Aidan will polish what she comes up with
- After that, any of us involved in a community will try answering the
questions (see next for the questions) and we'll try and integrate that
into the document, so others can see how we plan to  integrate stuff
- THEN we'll go to the communities
- We'll ask for their feedback on:
    - **Why is your community a success?**
    - **Please share some anecdotes that illustrate this**


        Comment from **Nazeefa**: Sound goods to me\^ Just a suggestion - it's not necessary but it would also be good to put these questions (differently, perhaps) in a form of survey so we can also ask others (Bioinformatics community on Twitter, Biostars, and/or Reddit?) for ideas. We don't have to restrict ourselves to community developers only. However, sending the questions to major communities should be the first priority.
        
        The idea is to have a list of communities and write a short paragraph
about them. Moreover, we can contact each of them to get opinions and
solve: \#9 i.e. interest in getting examples included from more
different communities
